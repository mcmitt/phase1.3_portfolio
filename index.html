            <h2>About Me:</h2>
            <p>I graduated from Adams College in 1981 with a degree in Computer Science.
               My interests are computer programming and robotics.</p>
            <p>I have a dog named Beaker who wears glasses and has allergies
               just like me. We both like long walks in the computer museum and our
               favorite store is Radio Shack.</p>
